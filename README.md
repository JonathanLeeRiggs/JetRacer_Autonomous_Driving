# JetRacer_Autonomous_Driving

This project was made by Doron Shaul and Jonathan Riggs, students at AU.

in this project we are working with the JetRacer - a robot car by NVIDIA.
The code is written in python and runs through Jupiter Notebook.

This project is here to simplify the way we work with autonomous driving. all the way from recieving an image from the camera and then manipulate it all the way to lane detection and stop sign detection.

The stop sign detection was made by haar cascade.

Here is an example for how it works:

And this is the same run from the car's point of view:

in this example we can see how the camera of the JetRacer detects lanes and driving according to the road.
